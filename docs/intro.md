# Introduction

Welcome to our Workflow Documentation! This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to our collaborative processes, tools, and frameworks.

## Purpose

This documentation system was created to:

- **Document** our daily and weekly workflow patterns
- **Standardize** our collaboration approaches
- **Track** project management practices
- **Share** best practices and lessons learned
- **Onboard** new team members effectively

## What You'll Find Here

### üîÑ Workflow Documentation
Detailed information about our daily activities, weekly patterns, and the tools we use for effective collaboration.

### ü§ù Collaboration Frameworks
Our decision-making processes, risk management approaches, and communication patterns that ensure productive teamwork.

### üìä Project Management
Standards and practices for managing projects, controlling changes, and maintaining documentation quality.

## Getting Started

1. **New to the team?** Start with the [Workflow Overview](/docs/workflow/overview)
2. **Looking for specific tools?** Check out [Tools and Frameworks](/docs/workflow/tools-and-frameworks)
3. **Managing a project?** Review our [Project Management](/docs/projects/project-management) standards

## Key Principles

Our workflow is built on these core principles:

- **Co-Decision Architecture**: All significant decisions require explicit approval
- **Risk-Aware Progression**: Proactive identification and mitigation of risks
- **Energy Management**: Respecting human limits and sustainable pace
- **Build-While-Using**: Creating tools as we need them, not before

## Contributing

This documentation is a living system. We encourage everyone to:

- Report issues or suggest improvements
- Update documentation as processes evolve
- Share lessons learned from projects
- Add new tools and frameworks as we adopt them
